# WDK Wallet Template (Next.js) — Roadmap

> This template and the [browser extension](https://github.com/plinkdev1/wdk-wallet-extension)
> are two surfaces over **one shared engine** (`wdk-web-core`) and **one shared
> component library** (`wdk-ui`). That is the point: a capability built once in the
> engine appears on every surface. This roadmap shows what ships today and what the
> shared engine unlocks next. Items are scoped against real, published
> `@tetherto/*` packages (verified to exist/install).

## ✅ Phase 1 — Worklet wallet foundation (SHIPPED)

- **Security model the bounty asks for** — the WDK engine runs inside a dedicated
  **Web Worker ("worklet")** for all seed custody, derivation, and signing; the
  React app holds only a Comlink proxy and never sees a private key.
- **Flows** — onboarding (create/import), unlock, dashboard, multi-chain selector,
  multi-account, balances, receive (QR), send (validated, explorer links), activity.
- **Reuse** — consumes the same `wdk-web-core` + `wdk-ui` packages as the extension.
- **Verified** — strict typecheck, full `next build`, and a headless runtime test
  that boots the worklet and generates a mnemonic through the real UI.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (the M1 deliverable), setup/integration/demo docs, media.

## ✅ Phase 2 — Multi-asset depth surfaced in the UI (SHIPPED)

The shared engine in this repo (`packages/wdk-web-core`) is at **full parity with
the browser extension**: it ships **EVM, Solana, Bitcoin (BIP-84), TON (v5r1), and
Tron** address/balance/send, **USDt/XAUt token balances + transfers**, and
**real-time transaction status** — all built, bundled, and covered by the same 100
engine tests. The template's worklet already exposes every one of these worker
methods; and the Next.js surface now wires them in:

1. ✅ **Bitcoin / TON / Tron** — address, balance, send + USD value are live in the
   dashboard, chain switcher, and send dialog (per-family address validation).
2. ✅ **DeFi — Lend · Swap · Bridge** — Aave V3, Velora, and USDT0 are live in a
   DeFi dialog on the dashboard (Comlink-driven; EVM chains).
3. **Activity + status monitoring** — the engine's status polling, in the app layer (next).
3. ✅ **Gasless (ERC-4337) + MoonPay on-ramp** — live in the app, config-driven
   (set `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUNDLER_URL` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_MOONPAY_API_KEY`).
4. **Lightning (Spark)** — `@tetherto/wdk-wallet-spark` instant BTC payments
   (shared bundler-shim work tracked in the extension roadmap).

## ✅ Phase 3 — Next.js-native concerns (mostly shipped)

4. ✅ **PWA** — installable: `app/manifest.ts` (web manifest) + a security-conscious
   app-shell service worker (`public/sw.js`) that caches **only** immutable
   `/_next/static/*` build assets and icons — never HTML, RPC, or any wallet data.
5. ✅ **Cross-VM bridge signpost** (ADR-005) — pasting a recipient address from a
   different network family in Send detects it and points the user at the right
   bridge (Wormhole for EVM↔Solana, etc.) instead of letting funds cross into a
   black hole (`wallet/bridge.ts`).
6. ✅ **Transaction detail view** — click any activity row for a detail modal
   (amount, parties, status, time, copyable hash, explorer link).
7. **SSR/edge boundaries** — document and harden the worklet/SSR split (the engine
   is client-only by design); App Router patterns for wallet-gated routes. *(open)*

## ⏳ Phase 4 — DeFi & distribution

7. In-wallet **swaps / lending / bridging** (`@tetherto/wdk-protocol-swap-velora-evm`,
   `-lending-aave-evm`, `-bridge-usdt0-evm`) and **fiat on-ramp** (`-fiat-moonpay`).
8. Deploy-ready reference (Vercel) + theming guide so teams can fork-and-ship.

---

The thesis — **write the engine once, ship on every framework** — is why this
template, the [extension](https://github.com/plinkdev1/wdk-wallet-extension/blob/main/ROADMAP.md),
and the [WooCommerce checkout](https://github.com/plinkdev1/wdk-checkout-and-woocommerce-plugin/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)
advance together.


## Customization & presentation follow-ups

- ✅ **Runtime theme/brand picker UI** — done. A gear-button **Appearance panel**
  (`AppearanceProvider` + `AppearanceDialog`) wires the `wdk-ui` pickers
  (`ThemePicker`, `BrandPicker`, `useThemePicker`, `useBrandPicker`,
  `useCustomPrimary`) into the app, with an any-hex primary override — all
  persisted to localStorage. Code-level theming still works (see `docs/CUSTOMIZATION.md`).
- **Capture screenshots** of the DeFi dialog (Lend/Swap/Bridge/Gasless) + Buy, and add to `media/screenshots/` + README (needs RPC-wired headless capture).


## Security / dependency follow-ups

- ✅ **Next.js 15 + React 19 migration** — done. Upgraded to Next 15.5.16 + React 19
  and rebuilt `wdk-ui` against React 19 (the 14 `JSX.Element` annotations now import
  the JSX type from 'react'). Cleared all five Next.js highs plus the postcss
  moderate; audit is down to a single unfixable low (`elliptic`). Production build
  green, 462 tests pass.
