# Component screenshot harness

Renders the real, worklet-coupled wallet surfaces in isolation so their imagery
can be regenerated without a running wallet (the worklet client + provider are
stubbed; the dark theme comes from the app's own `globals.css`).

```bash
# from apps/web
pnpm screenshots:build            # vite-build the harness → screenshots/dist
npx http-server screenshots/dist  # or any static server
# then headless-capture screenshots/dist/{swap,earn,send,asset,buy,shell}.html
```

- `stubs/` — `getWalletApi()` (a few read methods return sample data, rest async
  no-ops) + `useWallet()` (a benign context with sample transactions).
- `shell-entry.tsx` / `swap-entry.tsx` / `earn-entry.tsx` mount the real
  `<WalletShell>` at the Home / Swap / Earn tab; `send-entry.tsx` renders the
  real Send-flow primitives (`AmountInput` + `ReviewSheet`); `asset-entry.tsx`
  mounts `<AssetDetail>`; `buy-entry.tsx` mounts `<BuyDialog>`.
- `vite.config.ts` aliases `@/wallet/wallet-client` + `@/wallet/wallet-provider`
  to the stubs and `@` to `../src`.

Output is git-ignored (it includes the @web3icons dynamic chunks). The captured
PNGs live in `media/screenshots/`.
